Eavesdrop
=========

**Eavesdrop** is an application for listening in on TCP conversations on the
network your computer is attached to. See [Notes for
Newbies](<http://www.baurhome.net/software/newbies.html>) if you have not worked
with a network sniffer before. I strongly suggest you look into other
applications, such as [tcpdump](<http://www.tcpdump.org/>) (available in Mac OS
X 10.3 already) and [Ethereal](<http://www.ethereal.com/>) (available
through [fink](<http://fink.sourceforge.net/>) and probably other sources).

What's New
----------

Version 0.5a4:

-   Compiled as a Universal Binary. Promiscuous mode and file capture both work.
    Added a button to save images to TIFF (thanks, Will!). Removed the "Save"
    and "Save As..." menu options. Although this does not address the underlying
    issue, it will reduce questions until the next major release, which should
    fix that.

Project status
--------------

Originally written by Eric Baur, now maintained by William Entriken. Original
license unknown, but most everything will be rewritten and licensed MIT.

This project requires XCode 2.5 and OSX 10.4 Tiger to compile.

If you have access to a machine with OSX 10.4, please get in touch with
eavesdrop\@phor.net and we would appreciate a little assstiance.

The latest download binary is published here
https://github.com/fulldecent/eavesdrop/releases

The first step in this project is to compile the code as is and then start
working on modernizing it.
