Eavesdrop
=========

**Eavesdrop** is an application for listening in on TCP conversations on the
network your computer is attached to. See [Notes for
Newbies](<http://www.baurhome.net/software/newbies.html>) if you have not worked
with a network sniffer before. I strongly suggest you look into other
applications, such as [tcpdump](<http://www.tcpdump.org/>) (available in Mac OS
X 10.3 already) and [Ethereal](<http://www.ethereal.com/>) (available
through [fink](<http://fink.sourceforge.net/>) and probably other sources).

What's New
----------

Version 0.5a4:

-   Compiled as a Universal Binary. Promiscuous mode and file capture both work.
    Added a button to save images to TIFF (thanks, Will!). Removed the "Save"
    and "Save As..." menu options. Although this does not address the underlying
    issue, it will reduce questions until the next major release, which should
    fix that.
